# Program Instructions
## Run the code
To run the code, please run the GetIMDB.py (scraping data), Construct_tree.py (constructing tree from data), and Read_tree.py (reading the constructed tree and run the system) sequentially. To run the GetIMDB.py successfully, please enter your email on https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx to apply an API key first, and replace the key in the code to your key.
## Interact with the program
It is easy to interact with the system: just follow the instructions in the command lines. You will answer 'yes' or 'no' to a series of questions about your requirements of the recommended movies. Then you can enter a number to choose the demonstration modes of the recommended movie list. Moreover, you can choose to see the plot or browse the website of a specific movie in the list by entering a number. Finally, you can choose whether to play with the recommendation system again.

Note: if the system cannot find movies meeting your requirements, don't worry! Change your answers a little bit and try again.

Required Python packages: pandas, webbrowser, requests, bs4
